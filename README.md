# Password Checker

Designed and Developed a Password checker using Python which runs the password entered by the user and tells how many times the password has been hacked and accordingly suggests whether the user should change the password or continue with the same old password.

To run this pass word checker user needs to run the checkmypass.py file using the following command:

# python3 checkmypass "any password of choice" 

wait for few moments and the checker will log the result on console.

# Install python3 and use either terminal or command prompt to see the output.
